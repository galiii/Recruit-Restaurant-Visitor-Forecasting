# Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting

https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting

<p>Running a thriving local restaurant isn't always as charming as first impressions appear. There are often all sorts of unexpected troubles popping up that could hurt business.</p>

<p>One common predicament is that restaurants need to know how many customers to expect each day to effectively purchase ingredients and schedule staff members. This forecast isn't easy to make because many unpredictable factors affect restaurant attendance, like weather and local competition. It's even harder for newer restaurants with little historical data.</p>

<p>Recruit Holdings has unique access to key datasets that could make automated future customer prediction possible. Specifically, Recruit Holdings owns Hot Pepper Gourmet (a restaurant review service), AirREGI (a restaurant point of sales service), and Restaurant Board (reservation log management software).</p>

<p>In this competition, you're challenged to use reservation and visitation data to predict the total number of visitors to a restaurant for future dates. This information will help restaurants be much more efficient and allow them to focus on creating an enjoyable dining experience for their customers.</p>


<p>In this competition, you are provided a time-series forecasting problem centered around restaurant visitors. The data comes from two separate sites:</p>

<p>Hot Pepper Gourmet (hpg): similar to Yelp, here users can search restaurants and also make a reservation online
AirREGI / Restaurant Board (air): similar to Square, a reservation control and cash register system
You must use the reservations, visits, and other information from these sites to forecast future restaurant visitor totals on a given date. The training data covers the dates from 2016 until April 2017. The test set covers the last week of April and May of 2017. The test set is split based on time (the public fold coming first, the private fold following the public) and covers a chosen subset of the air restaurants. Note that the test set intentionally spans a holiday week in Japan called the "Golden Week."</p>
